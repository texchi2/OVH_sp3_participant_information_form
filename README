This package generates a Participant Information Form (PIF) for a
human research protocol at the University of Western Australia.

It requires the UWA logo in PDF format, which is available in SVG format at
https://static-listing.weboffice.uwa.edu.au/visualid/core-rebrand/img/uwacrest/,
and uses the Calibri (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/calibri)
fonts by default.
